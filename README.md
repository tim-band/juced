How to build
============

== Ubuntu ==

=== Install prerequisites ===

```sh
sudo apt install premake4 libc6-dev liblo-dev libjack-dev libfftw3-dev \
libccptest-dev libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libgcc-9-dev \
libfreetype-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev \
libglu1-mesa-dev libgl-dev
```

Possibly lash and sqlite need installing as well for some effects.

=== Build ===

Premake is used for the build process. Don't edit the makefiles, as they are autogenerated.

```sh
cd tools/linus
./manage make lib
```

Then you can make any plugin with `./manage make <name>`, or all apps with
`./manage make apps`. You can combine `lib` and `apps` into one step with:
`./manage make all`. For some reason, the VST debug host `jost` counts as a
plugin.

This will build the debug versions into the `bin/linux` directory.

=== Run ===

I have broken `./manage exec <name>` so you'll just have to run them from the
`bin/linux` directory.
